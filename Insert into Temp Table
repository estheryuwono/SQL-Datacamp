**Instruction:**
Compute the correlations between each pair of profits, profits_change, and revenues_change from the Fortune 500 data.

**Code:**
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS correlations;

CREATE TEMP TABLE correlations AS
SELECT 'profits'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(profits, profits) AS profits,
       corr(profits, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(profits, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT 'profits_change'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(profits_change, profits) AS profits,
       corr(profits_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(profits_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT 'revenues_change'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(revenues_change, profits) AS profits,
       corr(revenues_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(revenues_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

-- Select each column, rounding the correlations
SELECT measure, 
       round(profits::numeric, 2) AS profits,
       round(profits_change::numeric, 2) AS profits_change,
       round(revenues_change::numeric, 2) AS revenues_change
  FROM correlations;
